To customize the launch icon of your Flutter app, you can use the `flutter_launcher_icons` package, which makes it easy to generate the app icon for both Android and iOS platforms.

### Step 1: Add `flutter_launcher_icons` to `pubspec.yaml`

First, add the `flutter_launcher_icons` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file under the `dev_dependencies` section. Also, specify the configuration to point to your app's icon image.

Here's an example:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.9.2

flutter_icons:
  android: true
  ios: true
  image_path: "assets/icon/app_icon.png"
```

- The `image_path` points to the icon file you want to use. The icon should be a square PNG image with a high resolution (at least 512x512 pixels).
- Set `android` and `ios` to `true` to generate the icon for both platforms.
- If you need to generate a different icon for each platform, you can specify a different image for `android` and `ios`.

### Step 2: Place Your Icon in the Assets Folder

1. Create an `assets/icon` folder in your project if it doesn’t already exist.
2. Place your custom app icon (e.g., `app_icon.png`) in this folder.

Your project structure should look like this:

```
your_project/
  └── assets/
      └── icon/
          └── app_icon.png
```

### Step 3: Run the Icon Generator Command

After setting up your `pubspec.yaml` file, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

This will generate the necessary icons for both Android and iOS, and replace the default Flutter icon.

### Step 4: Check the Generated Icons

Once the icons are generated, Flutter will replace the default icons in the respective directories:

- For **Android**, the icons will be placed in `android/app/src/main/res/`.
- For **iOS**, the icons will be placed in `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`.

### Step 5: Clean and Rebuild the Project

To ensure the changes take effect, run a clean and rebuild:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter run
```

### Optional Configuration

You can also customize the icons further by specifying multiple icon sizes and filenames in the `flutter_icons` section of the `pubspec.yaml` file. For example, if you have different icons for Android and iOS:

```yaml
flutter_icons:
  android: true
  ios: true
  image_path: "assets/icon/app_icon.png"
  android_icon: "assets/icon/android_icon.png"
  ios_icon: "assets/icon/ios_icon.png"
```

For more advanced customization, you can refer to the [flutter_launcher_icons documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons).


Ah, I see! You’re asking about changing the name that appears under the app icon on the device (the app name in the launcher). This name is separate from the `name` field in `pubspec.yaml`. The launcher app name is defined in the native project settings for both Android and iOS.

### For Android:

To change the app name that appears under the icon on Android, you need to modify the `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` file.

1. Open `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`.
2. Look for the `<string name="app_name">` entry. It usually looks like this:

```xml
<string name="app_name">MyApp</string>
```

3. Change the value of `"app_name"` to your desired app name. For example:

```xml
<string name="app_name">Todo App</string>
```

### For iOS:

To change the app name on iOS, you need to modify the `Info.plist` file.

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Find the entry for `<key>CFBundleName</key>`. If it doesn’t exist, you can add it manually.
3. Change the value to your desired app name. For example:

```xml
<key>CFBundleName</key>
<string>Todo App</string>
```

### Summary:

- **Android**: Modify the `app_name` in `strings.xml`.
- **iOS**: Modify the `CFBundleName` in `Info.plist`.

To add a custom launcher icon in a Flutter app, you have two main options: using the `flutter_launcher_icons` package (recommended) or manually replacing the icons. Let’s walk through both options.

### **Option 1: Using the `flutter_launcher_icons` Package (Recommended)**

This is the easiest and most automated way to set up a custom launcher icon.

1. **Add `flutter_launcher_icons` to your `pubspec.yaml`**:

   Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `flutter_launcher_icons` package under `dev_dependencies` and the configuration under `flutter`:

   ```yaml
   dev_dependencies:
     flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.9.2

   flutter:
     uses-material-design: true

     # The following line will be used for the launcher icon configuration
     flutter_launcher_icons:
       android: true
       ios: true
       image_path: "assets/icon/app_icon.png"  # path to your icon
   ```

   Here, the `image_path` is the path to your icon image. Make sure to replace `"assets/icon/app_icon.png"` with the path to your own image.

2. **Place your icon image**:

   Ensure that your icon image (`app_icon.png` in the above example) is a square image (preferably 512x512 pixels for high resolution) and is located in the specified `assets/icon` directory.

3. **Run the command to generate icons**:

   In your terminal, run the following command to generate the launcher icons for both Android and iOS:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
   ```

   This will automatically generate the necessary launcher icons in the appropriate directories for Android (`mipmap-*` folders) and iOS (`Assets.xcassets`).

4. **Verify the changes**:

   Run your app on a device or emulator:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

   Your app should now display your custom launcher icon.

### **Option 2: Manually Replacing the Launcher Icon**

If you prefer to do things manually, here are the steps:

#### **For Android**:

1. **Prepare your icon files**:

   Create different sizes of your app icon to support various screen densities. The required sizes are:
   - `48x48` px (ldpi)
   - `72x72` px (mdpi)
   - `96x96` px (hdpi)
   - `144x144` px (xhdpi)
   - `192x192` px (xxhdpi)
   - `512x512` px (xxxhdpi)

   Place each icon in the appropriate folder inside `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*`:
   - `mipmap-mdpi/`
   - `mipmap-hdpi/`
   - `mipmap-xhdpi/`
   - `mipmap-xxhdpi/`
   - `mipmap-xxxhdpi/`

2. **Update the `AndroidManifest.xml`**:

   Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and ensure the `<application>` tag has the correct `android:icon` attribute pointing to the generated icon:

   ```xml
   <application
       android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
       android:label="Your App Name"
       android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme">
   ```

   If you manually placed icons, ensure that `@mipmap/ic_launcher` points to the correct icon file.

---

#### **For iOS**:

1. **Prepare the icon**:

   iOS requires different sizes of icons as well. You can create them using an image tool or use an online generator to create different sizes for iOS.

   Place your icon files in the `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` folder.

2. **Update the `Info.plist`**:

   iOS doesn’t require any change to `Info.plist` for the launcher icon. However, the icon images should be referenced properly in the `AppIcon.appiconset` folder. If you’re using Xcode, it will automatically recognize these images.

---

### **Verification**:

After completing either method (using the package or manually), run your app:

```bash
flutter run
```

Check the launcher icon on the device or emulator to ensure that your custom icon is displayed correctly.

### **Why Use `flutter_launcher_icons`?**

- **Automation**: It handles all the different icon sizes and placements for you.
- **Ease**: It’s much faster than manually resizing images and placing them in the right directories.
- **Consistency**: It ensures that your app icon is correctly set up for both Android and iOS.

If you follow the `flutter_launcher_icons` method, you’ll have a streamlined and efficient process to set a custom launcher icon for your app.
